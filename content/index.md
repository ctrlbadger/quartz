## Mission Statement

A published project is a finished project, and this website is about flinging ideas, thoughts, chunks of code, analysis and anything else that interests me into the world. I often struggle to finish a project as nothing ever feels perfect, this collection is my way of trying to change that. At the moment it should be a minimum viable project.

## Objectives for the Site
- An easy way to publish my personal notes onto the internet in a platform agnostic manner.
- Thoughts and writing on media, books, films, video games, etc...
- A place to share my adventures into music, be that folk, music samples or perhaps a tune library. 

## What have I created!
Hoping to add more but here's some bits and bobs
