I've not really got a wonderfully formed opinion of this film but there's some elements of it I really loved.

Firstly the Bernstein interview scene on the nature of being both a composer and a performer. It really stood out to me the idea of being a composer is such an introverted act where as being a performer is the completely opposite. To be both, is to have a split personality. 

I've often thought about this as I deeply enjoy being squirreled away in my bedroom practicing and improvising to myself but when a session comes round, there's an immense thrill of being the centre of attention.  

Secondly the film really captured the nature of small talk. Where the dialogue is second to the act of conversation itself. It’s such a great way to convey Bernstein’s interests and at times disinterest. At first it's a bit jarring to not fully understand a conversation but I think that's probably the film-makers intention.

You can stream Maestro (2023) on Netflix! It's well worth a watch!
