#review
I've been playing a little of a game called "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter." It's one of those games that I thought I would love, immersive environment, gorgeous visuals and the promise of an intriguing story. I've probably played about 2 or 3 hours at this point and I've given up on the game.  
  
This game felt like it was wasting my time, gorgeous environments with nothing in them, the detective gameplay, instead of feeling rewarding comes across as a hollow infuriating endeavour. Sometimes a game is cruelly labelled as a "walking simulator" due to most of the gameplay exploring a 3d world. In this case, the walking simulator moniker feels justified.  
  
With little narration travelling between locations, a frustrating gameplay loop of wondering if you should be on the path, off the path, missing out on key information and all the while increasingly concerned at the time you've wasted that could have been spent doing something else. I gave up. Maybe there is something in this game, I'm just pretty sure I won't find it.
