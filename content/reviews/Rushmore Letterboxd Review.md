This is a film I've got to come back to. At the heart of it, Max is every teenage boy and there's some part of him in all of us.  
The way Max still never really realises consequences of his actions, endlessly shuffling friends and enemies around like characters in one of his plays feels all to familiar.  
It's remarkable that while Max feels he is owed the world, puts himself at the centre of the universe and clamors for all the praise and attention he can get, you still empathise and understand him. It just goes to show how endlessly relatable Max is.  
In the scene where Margaret Yang played by Sara Tanaka talks about how she faked her results. When the shot comes back to Max, he purses his lips and looks down for a second. He realises that everyone's faking it in their own way, no matter how perfect you think they are.  
  
Side note: The way max drinks wine at the fancy dinner by gulping it down, mouth wide open is ICONIC.
