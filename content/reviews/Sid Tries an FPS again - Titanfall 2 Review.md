Been a while since I've played a proper FPS game and so it was refreshing to actually enjoy a shooter campaign. Titanfall 2 is about two things, massive fuck off robots that you can use to squish people and insane wall running movement. For a six hour singleplayer campaign, man does it make good use of those two ideas. There's never a dull run through a corridor or a lazy turret section to plod out time. 

Every level comes with a new idea from running on moving walls to massive mech battles. With some exceptional level progression the knowledge and skills you build up never feel too difficult or come out of left field. With a predictable story that works to serve the gameplay, the tutorial and first few levels serve to hype you up for when you finally get your own titan. 

Your Titan serves as a perfect companion with "BT" playing a deadpan but lovelable AI similar to Arnie in Terminator 2. The baddies are money hungry mercs who throughout each level are characterised through intercepted voice-overs each of which feel satisfying to defeat at the end of a level. My only gripe is that it isn't longer really. Each mechanic never outstays its welcome but really there's not much overlap between all the elements. Titanfall 2 is a modern classic for good reason.
